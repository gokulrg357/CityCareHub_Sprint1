# 📘Case Study: CityCareHub – Smart City Complaint & Resource Management Portal on Azure

## 🌐 Overview

A municipal corporation wants to build a cloud-based platform to streamline citizen complaints (e.g., garbage pickup, streetlight outage), track maintenance teams, monitor issue resolution SLAs, and manage civic resources. The solution will use Azure services and big data tools for real-time tracking, dashboards, and analytics on public services.

Key goals of this sprint include:
- Creating a normalized relational database schema  
- Simulating complaint log ingestion using Python ETL scripts  
- Capturing citizen feedback in both structured (ratings) and unstructured (text) formats  
- Running analytical SQL queries for insights into service performance
