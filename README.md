Overview of the Project :

Overview
A municipal corporation wants to build a cloud-based platform to streamline citizen complaints (e.g., garbage pickup, streetlight outage), track maintenance teams, monitor issue resolution SLAs, and manage civic resources. The solution will use Azure services and big data tools for real-time tracking, dashboards, and analytics on public services.
